<p>Hi! I'm Hope Carpenter. I'm a junior English major and digital
  studies minor.</p>

<p>I'm interested in web design, and I'm taking this course in order to
  learn more about web design. This past summer, I was lookig for web design
  internships and they all wanted coding experience that I ~didn't~ have.
  So, here I am!</p>

<p>I don't really have that much experience with web design, but I've worked
  on Wordpress and have self-taught myself some HTML and CSS for various class
  projects. This semester, my goal is to code a website all by myself. I don't
  know if this will happen, but I'm happy for any web design expereince I'll
  get regardless.</p>

<p>I chose four web-bases projects that I consider to be interesting. They are
  (in no specific order)
  <a href="http://flubandutter.nfb.ca/#/flubandutter"><i>Flub and Utter</i></a>
  by Jordan Scott, <a href="https://webyarns.com/howto/howto.html"><i>How to Rob a Bank</i></a>
    by Alan Bigelow,
  <a href="https://www.yhchang.com/DAKOTA.html"><i>DAKOTA</i></a> by Young-hae Chang
     Heavy Industries, and
  <a href=""><i>Glimmer</i></a> by Andy Campbell.</p>

<p><i>Flub and Utter<i/> was the first online project that I interacted with in a more
  aesthetic way. My Writin 101 class was called Voice, Noise, Sound, Sense and
  explored how we interact with the various soundscapes around us. <i>Blert</i>
  is an actual book Scott wrote about his experiences with a stutter,
  <i>Flub and Utter</i> a digital forray into merging that experience with
  technology. Featuring Scott reading the book, a close-up of Scott's mouth
  working through the words, the words Scott is reading, the audience's
  reaction, and even mini assides, <i>Flub and Utter</i> was my first
  experience of how technology, specifically web design, can heighten an
  experience.</p>

  <p>I discovered <i>How to Rob a Bank</i>, <i>DAKOTA</i>, and <i>Glimmer</i> in
    my DIG 220 course (Electronic Literature) last semester. I had already
    developed an appreciation for web design by designing my Wordpress in English 220, but
    I gained an equal appreciation for telling stories through web design from these three
    web experiences so it was hard to give one the axe!</p>

  <p>All three experiences tell a story in different ways, <i>How to Rob a Bank</i> being
    a funny spoof on a modern bank robbers rise and demise, <i>DAKOTA</i> a fast and loud (both on the screen and in the speakers)
    funky story, and <i>Glimmer</i> a more serious musing of a druggie after a mysterous package lands through his mail flap and
    unlocks a childhood memory they had long forgotten. These web experiences, including <i>Flub and Utter<i/>, give me hope that
    I will one day be able to create an online experience as moving as Scott, Bigelow, Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries, and Cambell did.</P>
