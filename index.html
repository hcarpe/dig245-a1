Hi! I'm Hope Carpenter. I'm a junior English major and digital studies minor.

I'm interested in web design, and I'm taking this course in order to learn more about web design. This past summer, I was lookig for web design internships and they all wanted coding experience that I ~didn't~ have. So, here I am!

I don't really have that much experience with web design, but I've worked on Wordpress and have self-taught myself some HTML and CSS for various class projects. This semester, my goal is to code a website all by myself. I don't know if this will happen, but I'm happy for any web design expereince I'll get regardless.
