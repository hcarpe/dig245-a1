  <p>Hi! I'm Hope Carpenter. I'm a junior English major and digital
    studies minor on the swim and dive team. Below is a video from our annual training trip
  last year in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. It's always a blast!</p>

  <p>I'm interested in web design, and I'm taking this course in order to
  learn more about web design. This past summer, I was lookig for web design
  internships and they all wanted coding experience that I ~didn't~ have.
  So, here I am!</p>

  <p>I don't really have that much experience with web design, but I've worked
  on Wordpress and have self-taught myself some HTML and CSS for various class
  projects. This semester, my goal is to code a website all by myself. I don't
  know if this will happen, but I'm happy for any web design expereince I'll
  get regardless.</p>

  <p>I chose four web-bases projects that I consider to be interesting. They are
  (in no specific order)
  <a href="http://flubandutter.nfb.ca/#/flubandutter" target="_blank"><i>Flub and Utter</i></a>
  by Jordan Scott, <a href="https://webyarns.com/howto/howto.html" target="_blank"><i>How to Rob a Bank</i></a>
    by Alan Bigelow,
  <a href="https://www.yhchang.com/DAKOTA.html" target="_blank"><i>DAKOTA</i></a> by Young-hae Chang
     Heavy Industries, and
  <a href="https://digitalfiction.dreamingmethods.com/glimmer/" target="_blank"><i>Glimmer</i></a> by Andy Campbell.</p>

  <p><i>Flub and Utter</i> was the first online project that I interacted with in a more
  aesthetic way. My Writing 101 class was called Voice, Noise, Sound, Sense and
  explored how we interact with the various soundscapes around us. <i>Blert</i>
  is an actual book Scott wrote about his experiences with a stutter,
  <i>Flub and Utter</i> a digital forray into merging that experience with
  technology. Featuring Scott reading the book, a close-up of Scott's mouth
  working through the words, the words Scott is reading, the audience's
  reaction, and even mini stutterous asides, <i>Flub and Utter</i> was my first
  experience of how technology, specifically web design, can heighten an
  experience.</p>

  <p>I discovered <i>How to Rob a Bank</i>, <i>DAKOTA</i>, and <i>Glimmer</i> in
    my DIG 220 course (Electronic Literature) last semester. I had already
    developed an appreciation for web design by designing my Wordpress in English 220, but
    I gained an equal (dare I say greater?) appreciation for telling stories through web design from these three
    web experiences so it was hard to give one the axe!</p>

  <p>All three experiences tell a story in different ways, <i>How to Rob a Bank</i> being
    a funny spoof on a modern bank robbers rise and demise, <i>DAKOTA</i> a fast and loud (both on the screen and in the speakers)
    funky story, and <i>Glimmer</i> a more serious musing of a druggie after a mysterous package lands through his mail flap and
    unlocks a childhood memory they had long forgotten. These web experiences, including <i>Flub and Utter</i>, give me hope that
    I will one day be able to create an online experience as moving as Scott, Bigelow, Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries, and Cambell did.</P>

  <p>One of my favorite mottos is to ask for forgiveness, not permission. Ironically,
    famous computer scientist Grace Hopper is credited with coining the phrase! From <a href="https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/grace-hopper" target="_blank"><i>The National Women's History Museum:</i></a></p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/grace-hopper">
    Hopperâ€™s work with computers not only gained national attention, but she was
    recognized internationally. In 1973, Hopper was named a distinguished fellow
    of the British Computer Society, then the first and only woman to hold
    the title. After retirement Hopper returned to the classroom, where she taught
    and inspired students until her death on January 1st, 1992. Although Hopper
    had many career accomplishments, she later told her biographer, her greatest
    joy came from teaching. In 2016, Hopper was posthumously awarded the
    Presidential Medal of Freedom. Her body is interred at Arlington National
    Cemetery.
    </blockquote>

  <p>Not a bad woman to look up to, especially since I'm interested in making a career in the computer
  science world myself!</p>
