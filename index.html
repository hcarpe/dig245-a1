<p>Hi! I'm Hope Carpenter. I'm a junior English major and digital
  studies minor.</p>

<p>I'm interested in web design, and I'm taking this course in order to
  learn more about web design. This past summer, I was lookig for web design
  internships and they all wanted coding experience that I ~didn't~ have.
  So, here I am!</p>

<p>I don't really have that much experience with web design, but I've worked
  on Wordpress and have self-taught myself some HTML and CSS for various class
  projects. This semester, my goal is to code a website all by myself. I don't
  know if this will happen, but I'm happy for any web design expereince I'll
  get regardless.</p>

<p>Three projects I consider to be interesting are Flub and Utter
  <link rel="Flub and Utter" href="http://flubandutter.nfb.ca/#/flubandutter">
  by Jordan Scott, </p>

<p>Flub and Utter was the first online project that I interacted with in a more
  aesthetic way. My Writin 101 class was called Voice, Noise, Sound, Sense and
  explored how we interact with the various soundscapes around us. <i>Blert</i>
  is an actual book Scott wrote about his experiences with a stutter,
  <i>Flub and Utter</i> a digital forray into merging that experience with
  technology. Featuring Scott reading the book, a close-up of Scott's mouth
  working through the words, the words Scott is reading, and the audience's
  reaction, <i>Flub and Utter</i> was my first experience of how technology,
  specifically web design, can heighten an experience.</p>
